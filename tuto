#Flash sd card with motioneye OS 
#Write The OS Image

All releases are available from here and are marked by date.

    download the latest stable release called motioneyeos-[board]-yyyymmdd.img.gz, where [board] is the name of your board

    extract the image file from the archive

    write the image file to your SD card:

    If you use Windows, just follow these instructions.

    If you use Linux or OSX, there's a writeimage.sh script that will do everything for you, including the optional setup of a wireless network connection and setting a static IP address. Just run the script as follows (replacing the arguments with appropriate values):

     ./writeimage.sh -d /dev/mmcblk0 -i "/path/to/motioneyeos.img"

    note: specify the device path to the disk and not to some partition (e.g. /dev/mmcblk0 instead of /dev/mmcblk0p1)

    You can preconfigure a wireless network connection:

     ./writeimage.sh -d /dev/mmcblk0 -i "/path/to/motioneyeos.img" -n 'yournet:yourkey'

    If you prefer a static IP instead of DHCP, just run the following command:

     ./writeimage.sh -d /dev/mmcblk0 -i "/path/to/motioneyeos.img" -s "192.168.1.101/24:192.168.1.1:8.8.8.8"

    Any other image writing method should work, including using the Unix dd command.

If you are having problems using writeimage.sh try using https://etcher.io/ as mentioned in Issue #857
#disable green (ACT) LED 
# Set the Pi Zero ACT LED trigger to 'none'.
echo none | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/trigger

# Turn off the Pi Zero ACT LED.
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/led0/brightness

To make these settings permanent, add the following lines to your Pi's /boot/config.txt file and reboot:

# Disable the ACT LED on the Pi Zero.
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=on
